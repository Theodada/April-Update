            <h2>Core of what programming is</h2>
            <p>
                Programming and software development involve a broad range of activities, but at a high level,
                 they can be categorized into three main areas: data storage, manipulation, and presentation.
                Data storage refers to the process of storing information in a structured way so that it can be retrieved and
                used later. This involves working with databases, file systems, and other storage mechanisms to ensure that 
                 data is stored efficiently and securely.</p>
            <p> Data manipulation involves the process of transforming data in various ways to make it more useful. 
                This includes tasks like sorting, filtering, aggregating, and transforming data in ways that enable it 
                to be analyzed or used in other applications.</p>
            <p>  Data presentation involves the process of presenting data in a way that is meaningful and useful to users. 
                This includes tasks like designing user interfaces, creating reports and visualizations, and developing 
                applications that enable users to interact with data in various ways.</p>
            <p> Overall, programming and software development are about creating solutions that enable users to store, 
                manipulate, and present data in ways that help them achieve their goals.
